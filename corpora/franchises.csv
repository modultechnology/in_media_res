1|Franchise|Star Trek is an iconic, long-running science-fiction franchise with six live-action television series, an animated television series, and thirteen live-action movies spanning three generations of characters and six decades of television. And it's still going, with a new series having been released late September 2017. Another new series was announced in August 2018 with Patrick Stewart set to reprise his role as Captain Jean-Luc Picard from Star Trek: The Next Generation.|
2|Franchise|Star Trek: The Next Generation is a science fiction show created by Gene Roddenberry as part of the Star Trek franchise.|
3|Franchise|Star Trek is the first show in the Star Trek franchise. After the release of its spinoff series and the movies, it has been retroactively called Star Trek: The Original Series to differentiate it from the franchise as a whole.|

6|Franchise|Star Trek: Picard is an upcoming TV series set in the Star Trek universe. Patrick Stewart reprises his role of Jean-Luc Picard from Star Trek: The Next Generation.

Living on his family vineyard, he's approached by a mysterious woman looking for help. This leads him on a new journey, reuniting with old friends and seeking new allies for one more mission.|
7|Franchise|Star Trek is the eleventh movie in the Star Trek film series, released in 2009.|
8|Franchise|As a rule, Star Trek makes no effort to maintain continuity outside of its Live-Action Television series and films — in fact, for a while, there was a directive that tie-ins couldn't reference anything except the live-action canon. Novels, comics, video games, roleplaying games, technical manuals etc. draw from their common origins, but exist largely independent of each other save for occasional Shout Outs or borrowed elements.|
9|Franchise|Star Trek: 25th Anniversary was the first adventure videogame based on the Star Trek franchise, released in 1992 by Interplay.

10|Franchise|And finally, while there were previous antecedents (such as the case of Sherlock Holmes and The Man From Uncle) Star Trek effectively gave rise to Fandom as we know it: when Star Trek: The Original Series began to pick up steam in syndication, fans organized conventions, wrote fanfiction, dressed in costume, and generally made enough noise to keep the franchise going for fifty years and counting. Every fandom since has grown from that original outpouring of fannish activity and devotion.|
