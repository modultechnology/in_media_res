24|Climate|As highlighted above, media coverage in the United States during the Bush Administration often emphasized and exaggerated scientific uncertainty over climate change, reflecting the interests of the political elite.|
25|Climate|On the other hand, Beck suggests that a major benefit of global media is that it brings distant issues within our consciousness.|
26|Climate|For example, Bill McKibben, an environmental activist, provides one approach to inspiring action: a war-like mobilization, where climate change is the enemy.|
27|Climate|These popular movements usually are neglected by the United States due to corporate relationships within the political sphere of influence.|
28|Climate|The discourse was dominated by matters of government responsibility, policy-making, policy measures for mitigation, and ways to mitigate climate change; with the issue coverage by mass media outlets continuing to act as an important means of communicating environmental concerns to the general public, rather than introducing new ideas about the topic itself.|
29|Climate|Across various nations, including Canada, there has been an increased effort in the use of celebrities in climate change coverage, which is able to gain audience attention, but in turn, it reinforces individualized rather than structural interpretations of climate change responsibility and solutions .|

32|Climate|The IPCC Assessment Reports in 1995 and in 2001 established an increasingly strong scientific consensus, yet the media continued to present the science as contentious.|
33|Climate|The most watched news network in the United States, Fox News, most of the time promotes climate misinformation and employs tactics that distract from the urgency of global climate change, according to a 2019 study by Public Citizen.|
34|Climate|It has been suggested that the association of climate change with the Arctic in popular media may undermine effective communication of the scientific realities of anthropogenic climate change.|
35|Climate|As a result of the Trump Presidency, media coverage on climate change is expected to decline during his term as president.|
36|Climate|Climate change communication research frequently studies the effectiveness of that media. Some researchers and journalists believe that media coverage of political issues is adequate and fair, while a few feel that it is biased.|
37|Climate|Media attention is especially high in carbon dependent countries with commitments under the Kyoto Protocol.|
38|Climate|A study that tracked press reports about a climate change article in the journal Nature found that "results and conclusions of the study were widely misrepresented, especially in the news media, to make the consequences seem more catastrophic and the timescale shorter."|
39|Climate|Historian Michael Parenti, for instance, alleges that the American media serves corporate interests by "inventing reality."|

72|Climate|The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is an intergovernmental body of the United Nations that is dedicated to providing the world with objective, scientific information relevant to understanding the scientific basis of the risk of human-induced[3] climate change, its natural, political, and economic impacts and risks, and possible response options.|
73|Climate|The IPCC does not carry out original research, nor does it monitor climate or related phenomena itself. Rather, it assesses published literature, including peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed sources.|
74|Climate|The IPCC has published five comprehensive assessment reports reviewing the latest climate science, as well as a number of special reports on particular topics.|
75|Climate|There is widespread support for the IPCC in the scientific community, which is reflected in publications by other scientific bodies and experts.|
76|Climate|Since the IPCC does not carry out its own research, it operates on the basis of scientific papers and independently documented results from other scientific bodies, and its schedule for producing reports requires a deadline for submissions prior to the report's final release.|
77|Climate|In principle, this means that any significant new evidence or events that change our understanding of climate science between this deadline and publication of an IPCC report cannot be included. In an area of science where our scientific understanding is rapidly changing, this has been raised as a serious shortcoming in a body which is widely regarded as the ultimate authority on the science.|

90|Climate|With a PhD in medicine, Lovelock began his career performing cryopreservation experiments on rodents, including successfully thawing frozen specimens. His methods were influential in the theories of cryonics (the cryopreservation of humans).|
91|Climate|Lovelock could not at first afford to go to university, something which he believes helped prevent him becoming overspecialised and aided the development of Gaia theory.|
92|Climate|It was while working as a consultant for NASA that Lovelock developed the Gaia hypothesis, for which he is most widely known.|
93|Climate|Lovelock has become concerned about the threat of global warming from the greenhouse effect. In 2004 he caused a media sensation when he broke with many fellow environmentalists by pronouncing that "only nuclear power can now halt global warming".|
